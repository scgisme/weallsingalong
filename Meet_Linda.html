                <p>Linda has been singing over 50 years, pretty much most of her life.  She sang in church, 
                in the church choir, in chorus at school, with various musical groups and performers, 
                and for the last 20 years, as a music teacher to K-1 students, now with the Elders.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Linda's first musical instrument was a ukelele at 7 and then first guitar at 8 !!!!  
                She also learned piano, and clarinet, yet guitar remains her instrument of choice, oh,
                and her voice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Linda is a <span>Breast Cancer survivor</span>.  As she went through the healing process during and after treatments, 
                she realized, that she wanted to use her voice and talents to help others, thus We All Sing Along was created.</p>
                <br>
                <p>"Music connects me to a Heart Space like nothing else.  Singing with others has been and will always be, my greatest joy!"</p>
