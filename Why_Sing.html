            <p class="blue">Music stimulates the emotions. Music stimulates distinct parts of the brain in a way that's very different from language. 
                Music therapy is a simple yet effective way to evoke positive emotions and help to reduce stress. Elderly patients enjoy 
                hearing and singing songs and melodies they recognize from their youth.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="orange">Singing helps foster communication. One of the most devastating aspects of dementia and Alzheimer's is how they cut the sufferer off
                 from the world. Dementia patients often have trouble understanding or forming sentences. Music provides a bridge that helps 
                 these patients connect with friends and family members. Patients who have memory problems often still remember the words to
                  their favorite songs. Singing together is a way to bond when verbal communication is difficult.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="blue">Researchers believe music stimulates many parts of the brain at the same time, such as those areas affecting language, mood and 
                movement, along with the senses of hearing, sight, sound and touch. Research at the University of California at Davis pinpointed 
                an area of the brain which stores memories by linking them to familiar songs and the emotions associated with those memories</p>
            <br>
            <p class="orange">According to a study conducted at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and published in Trends in Cognitive Science, 
                April 2013, evidence found that the benefits of singing significantly improved psychological health and well-being through the 
                engagement of neurochemical systems responsible for reward, motivation, pleasure, stress/arousal, immunity and social affiliation.</p>
